Introduction

Afghanistan

Background:  Afghanistan's recent history is characterized by war
and civil strife, with intermittent periods of relative calm and
stability. The Soviet Union invaded in 1979 but was forced to withdraw 10
years later by anti-Communist mujahidin forces supplied and trained by the
US, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and others. Fighting subsequently continued
among the various mujahidin factions, giving rise to a state of warlordism
that spawned the Taliban in the early 1990s. The Taliban was able to seize
most of the country, aside from Northern Alliance strongholds primarily
in the northeast, until US and allied military action in support of the
opposition following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks forced the
group's downfall. The four largest Afghan opposition groups met in Bonn,
Germany, in late 2001 and agreed on a plan for the formulation of a new
government structure that resulted in the inauguration of Hamid KARZAI
as Chairman of the Afghan Interim Authority (AIA) on 22 December 2001.
In addition to occasionally violent political jockeying and ongoing
military action to root out remaining terrorists and Taliban elements,
the country suffers from enormous poverty, a crumbling infrastructure,
and widespread land mines.

Economy Afghanistan

Economy - overview:  Afghanistan is an extremely poor, landlocked
country, highly dependent on farming and livestock raising (sheep and
goats). Economic considerations have played second fiddle to political
and military upheavals during two decades of war, including the nearly
10-year Soviet military occupation (which ended 15 February 1989). During
that conflict one-third of the population fled the country, with Pakistan
and Iran sheltering a combined peak of more than 6 million refugees.
Gross domestic product has fallen substantially over the past 20 years
because of the loss of labor and capital and the disruption of trade
and transport; severe drought added to the nation's difficulties
in 1998-2001. The majority of the population continues to suffer
from insufficient food, clothing, housing, and medical care, problems
exacerbated by military operations and political uncertainties. Inflation
remains a serious problem. Following the US-led coalition war that led
to the defeat of the Taliban in November 2001 and the formulation of
the Afghan Interim Authority (AIA) resulting from the December 2001 Bonn
Agreement, International efforts to rebuild Afghanistan were addressed at
the Tokyo Donors Conference for Afghan Reconstruction in January 2002,
when $4.5 billion was collected for a trust fund to be administered
by the World Bank. Priority areas for reconstruction include the
construction of education, health, and sanitation facilities, enhancement
of administrative capacity, the development of the agricultural sector,
and the rebuilding of road, energy, and telecommunication links.

Economy Bermuda

Economy - overview:  Bermuda enjoys one of the highest per capita
incomes in the world, with its economy primarily based on providing
financial services for international business and luxury facilities for
tourists. The effects of 11 September 2001 have had both positive and
negative ramifications for Bermuda. On the positive side, a number of
new reinsurance companies have located on the island, contributing to
the expansion of an already robust international business sector. On
the negative side, Bermuda's already weakening tourism industry - which
derives over 80% of its visitors from the US - has been further hit as
American tourists have chosen not to travel. Most capital equipment
and food must be imported, with the US serving as the primary source
of goods, followed by the UK. Bermuda's industrial sector is small,
although construction continues to be important. Agriculture is limited,
only 6% of the land being arable.

East Timor

Introduction East Timor

Background:  The Portuguese colony of Timor declared itself independent
from Portugal on 28 November 1975 and was invaded and occupied by
Indonesian forces nine days later. It was subsequently incorporated
into Indonesia in July 1976 as the province of Timor Timur. A so-called
campaign of pacification followed, during which time an estimated
100,000 to 250,000 individuals lost their lives. On 30 August 1999,
in a UN-supervised popular referendum, the people of Timor Timur
voted for independence from Indonesia. On 20 May 2002, East Timor was
internationally recognized as an independent state and the world's
newest democracy.

Economy East Timor

Economy - overview:  In late 1999, about 70% of the economic
infrastructure of East Timor was laid waste by Indonesian troops and
anti-independence militias, and 260,000 people fled westward. Over the
next three years, however, a massive international program, manned by
5,000 peacekeepers (8,000 at peak) and 1,300 police officers, led to
substantial reconstruction in both urban and rural areas. By mid-2002,
all but about 50,000 of the refugees had returned. The country faces
great challenges in continuing the rebuilding of infrastructure and the
strengthening of the infant civil administration. One promising long-term
project would be development of oil resources in nearby waters.

agricultural areas. Because the country exports primary products such
as oil, bananas, and shrimp, fluctuations in world market prices can
have a substantial domestic impact. Ecuador joined the World Trade
Organization in 1996, but has failed to comply with many of its accession
commitments. The aftermath of El Nino and depressed oil market of 1997-98
drove Ecuador's economy into a free-fall in 1999. The beginning of 1999
saw the banking sector collapse, which helped precipitate an unprecedented
default on external loans later that year. Continued economic instability
drove a 70% depreciation of the currency throughout 1999, which forced
a desperate government to ""dollarize"" the currency regime in 2000. The
move stabilized the currency, but did not stave off the ouster of the
government. Gustavo NOBOA, who assumed the presidency in January 2000,
has managed to pass substantial economic reforms and mend relations
with international financial institutions. Ecuador completed its first
standby agreement since 1986 when the IMF Board approved a 10 December
2001 disbursement of $96 million, the final installment of a $300 million
standby credit agreement.

population enjoys a per capita income twice that of the Philippines and
much of Micronesia.  Long-run prospects for the key tourist sector have
been greatly bolstered by the expansion of air travel in the Pacific,
the rising prosperity of leading East Asian countries, and the willingness
of foreigners to finance infrastructure development.

Taiwan

Introduction

Taiwan

Background:  In 1895, military defeat forced China to cede Taiwan
to Japan, however it reverted to Chinese control after World War
II. Following the Communist victory on the mainland in 1949, 2 million
Nationalists fled to Taiwan and established a government using the 1947
constitution drawn up for all of China. Over the next five decades,
the ruling authorities gradually democratized and incorporated the
native population within its governing structure. This culminated in
2000, when Taiwan underwent its first peaceful transfer of power from
the Nationalist to the Democratic Progressive Party. Throughout this
period, the island has prospered to become one of East Asia's economic
""Tigers."" The dominant political issues continue to be the relationship
between Taiwan and China - specifically the question of eventual
unification - as well as domestic political and economic reform.

Economy Taiwan

Economy - overview:  Taiwan has a dynamic capitalist economy
with gradually decreasing guidance of investment and foreign
trade by government authorities. In keeping with this trend,
some large government-owned banks and industrial firms are being
privatized. Real growth in GDP has averaged about 8% during the
past three decades. Exports have provided the primary impetus for
industrialization. The trade surplus is substantial, and foreign
reserves are the world's third largest. Agriculture contributes 2%
to GDP, down from 35% in 1952. Traditional labor-intensive industries
are steadily being moved offshore and replaced with more capital- and
technology-intensive industries.  Taiwan has become a major investor in
China, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Vietnam; 50,000
Taiwanese businesses are established in China. Because of its conservative
financial approach and its entrepreneurial strengths, Taiwan suffered
little compared with many of its neighbors from the Asian financial
crisis in 1998-99. The global economic downturn, however, combined
with poor policy coordination by the new administration and increasing
bad debts in the banking system, pushed Taiwan into recession in 2001,
the first whole year of negative growth since 1947.  Unemployment also
reached a level not seen since the 1970s oil crisis.

Introduction

United Kingdom

Background:  Great Britain, the dominant industrial and maritime power
of the 19th century, played a leading role in developing parliamentary
democracy and in advancing literature and science. At its zenith, the
British Empire stretched over one-fourth of the earth's surface. The
first half of the 20th century saw the UK's strength seriously depleted
in two World Wars. The second half witnessed the dismantling of the
Empire and the UK rebuilding itself into a modern and prosperous
European nation. As one of five permanent members of the UN Security
Council, a founding member of NATO, and of the Commonwealth, the UK
pursues a global approach to foreign policy; it currently is weighing
the degree of its integration with continental Europe. A member of the
EU, it chose to remain outside the European Monetary Union for the time
being. Constitutional reform is also a significant issue in the UK. The
Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales, and the Northern
Ireland Assembly were established in 1999.

aims to reduce the amount of industrial and commercial waste disposed
of in landfill sites to 85% of 1998 levels and to recycle or compost at
least 25% of household waste, increasing to 33% by 2015; between 1998-99

Economy United Kingdom

Economy - overview:  The UK, a leading trading power and financial center,
is one of the quartet of trillion dollar economies of Western Europe. Over
the past two decades the government has greatly reduced public ownership
and contained the growth of social welfare programs. Agriculture is
intensive, highly mechanized, and efficient by European standards,
producing about 60% of food needs with only 1% of the labor force.
The UK has large coal, natural gas, and oil reserves; primary energy
production accounts for 10% of GDP, one of the highest shares of
any industrial nation. Services, particularly banking, insurance, and
business services, account by far for the largest proportion of GDP while
industry continues to decline in importance. GDP growth slipped in 2001
as the global downturn, the high value of the pound, and the bursting
of the ""new economy"" bubble hurt manufacturing and exports. Still, the
economy is one of the strongest in Europe; inflation, interest rates,
and unemployment remain low, and the government expects growth of 2% to
2.5% in 2002. The relatively good economic performance has complicated
the BLAIR government's efforts to make a case for Britain to join the
European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). The Prime Minister has
pledged to hold a public referendum if membership meets Chancellor of
the Exchequer BROWN's five economic ""tests."" Scheduled for assessment
by mid-2003, the tests will determine whether joining EMU would have a
positive effect on British investment, employment, and growth. Critics
point out, however, that the economy is thriving outside of EMU, and
they point to public opinion polls that continue to show a majority of
Britons opposed to the single currency.

United States

Introduction

United States

Background:  Britain's American colonies broke with the mother country
in 1776 and were recognized as the new nation of the United States of
America following the Treaty of Paris in 1783. During the 19th and 20th
centuries, 37 new states were added to the original 13 as the nation
expanded across the North American continent and acquired a number of
overseas possessions. The two most traumatic experiences in the nation's
history were the Civil War (1861-65) and the Great Depression of the
1930s. Buoyed by victories in World Wars I and II and the end of the Cold
War in 1991, the US remains the world's most powerful nation-state. The
economy is marked by steady growth, low unemployment and inflation,
and rapid advances in technology.

Economy United States

Economy - overview:  The US has the largest and most technologically
powerful economy in the world, with a per capita GDP of $36,300. In this
market-oriented economy, private individuals and business firms make
most of the decisions, and the federal and state governments buy needed
goods and services predominantly in the private marketplace. US business
firms enjoy considerably greater flexibility than their counterparts
in Western Europe and Japan in decisions to expand capital plant, lay
off surplus workers, and develop new products. At the same time, they
face higher barriers to entry in their rivals' home markets than the
barriers to entry of foreign firms in US markets. US firms are at or near
the forefront in technological advances, especially in computers and in
medical, aerospace, and military equipment, although their advantage has
narrowed since the end of World War II. The onrush of technology largely
explains the gradual development of a ""two-tier labor market"" in which
those at the bottom lack the education and the professional/technical
skills of those at the top and, more and more, fail to get comparable
pay raises, health insurance coverage, and other benefits. Since 1975,
practically all the gains in household income have gone to the top 20%
of households. The years 1994-2000 witnessed solid increases in real
output, low inflation rates, and a drop in unemployment to below 5%. The
year 2001 witnessed the end of the boom psychology and performance,
with output increasing only 0.3% and unemployment and business failures
rising substantially. The response to the terrorist attacks of September
11 showed the remarkable resilience of the economy. Moderate recovery is
expected in 2002, with the GDP growth rate rising to 2.5% or more. A major
short-term problem in first half 2002 was a sharp decline in the stock
market, fueled in part by the exposure of dubious accounting practices in
some major corporations. Long-term problems include inadequate investment
in economic infrastructure, rapidly rising medical and pension costs of
an aging population, sizable trade deficits, and stagnation of family
income in the lower economic groups.

Uruguay

Introduction

Uruguay

Background:  A violent Marxist urban guerrilla movement, the Tupamaros,
launched in the late 1960s, led Uruguay's president to agree to military
control of his administration in 1973. By the end of the year the rebels
had been crushed, but the military continued to expand its hold throughout
the government. Civilian rule was not restored until 1985.  Uruguay's
political and labor conditions are among the freest on the continent.

Economy Uruguay

Economy - overview:  Uruguay's economy is characterized by an
export-oriented agricultural sector, a well-educated workforce,
and high levels of social spending. After averaging growth of 5%
annually in 1996-98, in 1999-2001 the economy suffered from lower
demand in Argentina and Brazil, which together account for nearly
half of Uruguay's exports. Despite the severity of the trade shocks,
Uruguay's financial indicators remained more stable than those of its
neighbors, a reflection of its solid reputation among investors and its
investment-grade sovereign bond rating - one of only two in South America.
Challenges for the government of President Jorge BATLLE include reducing
the budget deficit, expanding Uruguay's trade ties beyond its Mercosur
trade partners, and reducing the costs of public services. GDP fell by
1.3% in 2000 and by 1.5% in 2001.
